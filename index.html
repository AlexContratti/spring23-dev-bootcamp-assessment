            The most meaningful involvement that I am passionate about dates back to when I initiated a Red Cross Blood Donation
            Thank You Card Program in 2015 to increase awareness of the need for blood donations. Every year this activity is
            underway we collect roughly 1000 cards created from kids in my old school district, which we distribute to different
            blood drives through the Red Cross. I have seen the impact these cards have firsthand; they genuinely are something
            blood donors appreciate. Knowing how important this type of work is, I would love to contribute to creating websites for
            similar foundations or programs.
